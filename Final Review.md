## Chap 10 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand
The purpose of the aggregate supply–aggregate demand model (AS-AD model) is to explain how real GDP and the price level are determined and how they interact. It is a model of an imaginary market for the total of all the final goods and services that make up real GDP. The quantity in this “market” is real GDP and the price is the price level measured by the GDP deflator.

### Aggregate Supply

* The quantity of real GDP supplied is the total quantity that firms plan to produce during a given period. It depends on:
    - amount of labor employed
    - amount of physical and human capital
    - state of technology
* Aggregate supply: the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied and the price level.
* Long-run aggregate supply: when the money wa ge rate changes in step with the price level to maintain full-employment.
    - The quantity of real GDP supplied at full employment = potential GDP.
    - The long-run aggregate supply (LAS) curve is vertical at potential GDP.
    - The price level and the money wage rate change by the same percentage.
    - Potential GDP is independent of the price level.
* Short-run aggregate supply: when the money wage rate, the prices of other resources, and potential GDP remain constant.
    - higher price level, less purchase less investment and less exports, more supply.
    - the curve (SAS curve) is upward sloping.
* SAS and LAS interacts
    - if price level falls below the intersection: the quantity of real GDP supplieddecreases along the SAS curve, less than potential GDP.
    - other wise it goes over the potential GDP
* Supply curve shifts when:
    - increase in potential GDP -> shifts both LAS and SAS rightward (increase). If the full-employment price level remains constant, the shifts by the same amount.
    - rises in Money Wage Rate -> SAS shifts leftward (decrease). LAS does not change
    
### Aggregate Demand
**The quantity of real GDP demanded(Y) = consumption expenditures(C) + investment(I) + government expenditure(G) + (exports(X) - imports(M))**
* The quantity of real GDP demanded is the total amount of final goods and services produced in Canada that people, businesses, governments, and foreigners plan to buy. Buying plans depend on:
    - The price level
* the higher the price level, the smaller is the quantity of real GDP demanded. Curve is downward sloping.
    - Wealth effect: when the price level rises but other things remain the same, real wealth decreases. So people increase saving and decrease spending.
    - Intertemporal substitution effect: 
        - involving changing the timing of purchases of capital and consumer durable good. 
        - happens when the price level rises and other things remain the same, interest rate rise. 
        - That is, we still want to buy but we delay the time of buying.
    - International substitution effect:
        - When the Canadian price level rises and other things remaining the same
        - imports increase and exports decrease, so GDP demanded decreases
* The AD curve shifts when:
    - Increase (UP) in expectations of future income, future inflation rate, or future profits would make curve shifts rightward.
    - Fiscal policy: the **government**’s attempt to influence the economy by setting and changing **taxes**, making **transfer payments**, and **purchasing** goods and services
        - A tax cut or an increase in transfer payments increases households’ disposable income.
        - disposable income = aggregate income - taxes + transfer payments
        - **disposable income up -> AD UP**
        - government expenditure on goods and services UP -> AD UP
    - Monetary policy: The **Bank of Canada**’s attempt to influence the economy by changing **interest rate and the quantity of money**
        - lower interest rate -> expenditure UP -> AD UP
        - more quantity of money -> lower interest rate -> AD UP
    - The world economy
        - fall in exchange rate -> exports UP -> AD UP
        - rise in foreign income -> exports UP -> AD UP
