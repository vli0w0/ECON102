## Chap 10 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand
The purpose of the aggregate supply–aggregate demand model (AS-AD model) is to explain how real GDP and the price level are determined and how they interact. It is a model of an imaginary market for the total of all the final goods and services that make up real GDP. The quantity in this “market” is real GDP and the price is the price level measured by the GDP deflator.

### Aggregate Supply

* The quantity of real GDP supplied is the total quantity that firms plan to produce during a given period. It depends on:
    - amount of labor employed
    - amount of physical and human capital
    - state of technology
* Aggregate supply: the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied and the price level.
* Long-run aggregate supply: when the money wage rate changes in step with the price level to maintain full-employment.
