## Chap 10 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand
The purpose of the aggregate supply–aggregate demand model (AS-AD model) is to explain how real GDP and the price level are determined and how they interact. It is a model of an imaginary market for the total of all the final goods and services that make up real GDP. The quantity in this “market” is real GDP and the price is the price level measured by the GDP deflator.

### Aggregate Supply

* The quantity of real GDP supplied is the total quantity that firms plan to produce during a given period. It depends on:
    - amount of labor employed
    - amount of physical and human capital
    - state of technology
* Aggregate supply: the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied and the price level.
* Long-run aggregate supply: when the money wa ge rate changes in step with the price level to maintain full-employment.
    - The quantity of real GDP supplied at full employment = potential GDP.
    - The long-run aggregate supply (LAS) curve is vertical at potential GDP.
    - The price level and the money wage rate change by the same percentage.
    - Potential GDP is independent of the price level.
* Short-run aggregate supply: when the money wage rate, the prices of other resources, and potential GDP remain constant.
    - higher price level, less purchase less investment and less exports, more supply.
    - the curve (SAS curve) is upward sloping.
* SAS and LAS interacts
    - if price level falls below the intersection: the quantity of real GDP supplieddecreases along the SAS curve, less than potential GDP.
    - other wise it goes over the potential GDP
* Supply curve shifts when:
    - increase in potential GDP -> shifts both LAS and SAS rightward (increase). If the full-employment price level remains constant, the shifts by the same amount.
    - rises in Money Wage Rate -> SAS shifts leftward (decrease). LAS does not change
    
### Aggregate Demand
**The quantity of real GDP demanded(Y) = consumption expenditures(C) + investment(I) + government expenditure(G) + (exports(X) - imports(M))**
* The quantity of real GDP demanded is the total amount of final goods and services produced in Canada that people, businesses, governments, and foreigners plan to buy. Buying plans depend on:
    - The price level
* the higher the price level, the smaller is the quantity of real GDP demanded. Curve is downward sloping.
    - Wealth effect: when the price level rises but other things remain the same, real wealth decreases. So people increase saving and decrease spending.
    - Intertemporal substitution effect: 
        - involving changing the timing of purchases of capital and consumer durable good. 
        - happens when the price level rises and other things remain the same, interest rate rise. 
        - That is, we still want to buy but we delay the time of buying.
    - International substitution effect:
        - When the Canadian price level rises and other things remaining the same
        - imports increase and exports decrease, so GDP demanded decreases
* The AD curve shifts when:
    - Increase (UP) in expectations of future income, future inflation rate, or future profits would make curve shifts rightward.
    - Fiscal policy: the **government**’s attempt to influence the economy by setting and changing **taxes**, making **transfer payments**, and **purchasing** goods and services
        - A tax cut or an increase in transfer payments increases households’ disposable income.
        - disposable income = aggregate income - taxes + transfer payments
        - **disposable income up -> AD UP**
        - government expenditure on goods and services UP -> AD UP
    - Monetary policy: The **Bank of Canada**’s attempt to influence the economy by changing **interest rate and the quantity of money**
        - lower interest rate -> expenditure UP -> AD UP
        - more quantity of money -> lower interest rate -> AD UP
    - The world economy
        - fall in exchange rate -> exports UP -> AD UP
        - rise in foreign income -> exports UP -> AD UP
        
###  Macroeconomic Trends and Fluctuations

* Short-run macroeconomic equilibrium: intersection of AD and SAS
    - when actual above AD line, firms cut productions and prices
    - when below, firms increase productions and prices.
* Long-run macroeconomic equilibrium: when real GDP equals potential GDP. Money wages would adjust.
    - if not fully employed, SAS increases and shifts rightward
    - if over employed, SAS shifts leftward.
* When the quantity of money grows faster than potential GDP, AD increases more than SAS. 
    - Inflation and economic growth 
* Business Cycle happens because the money wage does not change rapidly enough to keep real GDP at potential GDP.
    - Output gap = Inflation Gap = real GDP - potential GDP (when above full-employment equilibrium)
    - Recessionary gap = potential GDP - real GDP (when under employement, output gap negative.)

### Macroeconomic Schools of Thought
1. Classical: the economy is self-regulating and always at full employment.
    - can be understood in terms of beliefs about aggregate demand and aggregate supply.
    - technological change is the most significant influence on both aggregate demand and aggregate supply
    - The money wage rate change pretty fast.
    - emphasizes the potential for taxes to stunt incentives and create inefficiency
    - new classical: business cycle fluctuations are the efficient responses of a well-functioning market economy that is bombarded by shocks that arise from the uneven pace of technological change.
2. Keynesian: active help from fiscal policy and monetary policy is required to operate at full employment
    - expectations are the most significant influence on aggregate demand
    - the money wage rate that lies behind the short-run aggregate supply curve is extremely sticky in the downward direction
    - new Keynesian: not only is the money wage rate sticky, but also are the prices of goods.
3. Monetarist: economy is self-regulating and that it will normally operate at full employment, provided that monetary policy is not erratic and that the pace of money growth is kept steady.
    - the quantity of money is the most significant influence on aggregate demand.
    - If the Bank of Canada keeps money growing at a steady pace, aggregate demand fluctuations will be minimized and the economy will operate close to full employment. All recessions result from inappropriate monetary policy.
    - The money wage rate is sticky.

## Chap 11 Expenditure Multipliers
The Keynesian model describes the economy in the very short run when prices are fixed.
Because each firm’s price is fixed, for the economy as a whole:
1. The price level is fixed.
2. Aggregate demand determines real GDP.

### Aggregate expenditure
Aggregate expenditure has four components:
1. Consumption expenditure
2. Investment
3. Government expenditure on goods and services
4. Net exports (exports minus imports)

Disposable income (YD) = aggregate income (Y) - net taxes (taxes plus transfer payments T).

Also, YD = expenditure on goods or services (C) + Savings (S)

### Consumption function

C = autonomous consumption + marginal propensity to consume(MPC) * YD

C = Ca + MPC * (Y - T)

MPC = delta C / delta YD (the fraction of a change in YD that is
spent on consumption.)

Saving function: 
S = − Ca + (1 − MPC )xYD

marginal propensity to save (MPS) =  delta S / delta YD

MPC + MPS = 1

### Import function
M = MPI ∙ Y

Marginal propensity to import (MPI) = delta M/ delta Y


The aggregate
expenditure (AE)
curve summarizes
the relationship
between aggregate
planned expenditure
and real GDP.

### Equilibrium expenditure
Equilibrium expenditure occurs when aggregate planned expenditure (AE) equals real GDP (Y).

The multiplier equals the change in equilibrium expenditure and real GDP (Y) that results from a change in autonomous expenditure (A) divided by the change in autonomous expenditure.

## Chap 12 Business Cycles, Inflation, and Deflation 
In the long run, inflation occurs if the quantity of money grows faster than potential GDP.
In the short run, many factors can start an inflation, and real GDP and the price level interact.

Inflation rate = Money growth rate + Growth rate of velocity – Real GDP growth rate

A Phillips curve is a curve that shows the relationship between the inflation rate and the
unemployment rate.

The long-run Phillips curve (LRPC) is
vertical at the natural unemployment rate.

The SRPC intersects the LRPC at the
expected inflation rate 

An increase in the expected inflation rate
shifts the short-run Phillips curve rightwards, but it
does not shift the long-run Phillips curve.

An increase in the natural unemployment
rate shifts both the long-run and shortrun Phillips curves rightward.

### Mainstream Business Cycle
Because potential GDP grows at a steady pace while aggregate demand grows at a
fluctuating rate, real GDP fluctuates around potential GDP.
