### Chap 1 Intro 

* Economics: Choice, Scarity, Incentives
* - positive statement: what it is, descriptive statment, could be right or wrong, can be tested
  - normative statement: what should be, opinion, cannot be tested 
* Economics divided into micro and macro economics
  - micro about market, specifc decision/choices, including government's action
  - macro about performance of national and global economics, more about social interest
* factors of production:
  - land: all "gift of natures", incentive is rent
  - labor: work time and effort, incentive is wages
  - capital: tools, machines, building, etc. incentive is interest
  - entrepreneurship: human resource to put above 3 together, earns profit
* choice = tradeoff; people making rational choice comparing costs and benefits
* benefit: the gain/pleasure it brings, determined by preference
* Preference: what a person likes and dislikes and the intensity
* Opportunity Cost: sth of highest-value alternative that MUST be given up to get it
  - money need to pay + time need to use

### Chap 2 The Economic Problem
* PPF (production possibility frontier): boundary line of combination of goods/services
  - outside the frontier: unattainable
  - on and inside frontier: attainable
  - exactly on frontier: efficient
* marginal cost = opportunity cost of producing one more unit of it 
* marginal benefit = change in total benefit/change in quantity (usually one unit)
  - *principle of diminishing marginal benefit*: having more goods -> smaller marginal benefit & less willing to pay for additional unit
* marginal benefit curve: graph of margianl beneft of a good(on y axis) vs. quantity of good consumed(on x-axis)
* allocative efficiency: point on PPF at which marginal benefit = marginal cost
  - cannot product more good without giving up some other good we value more highly
* economic growth:expansion of production possibilities, an increase of standard of living. Two factors:
  - technological change: new goods/ better ways of producing
  - capital accumulation: growth of capital resources, including human capital.
* economic growth is not free. Must decrease production of consumption goods and services and use the resources in research/development
* comparative advantage: higher OC; absolute advantage higher producing rate/productivities

### Chap 4 Measuring GDP

#### GDP
GDP: Gross Domestic Product, market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given time period.
* final good: an item bought by its final user during a specified time period
  - contracts with an intermediate good, which is produced by a firm and sold to another firm, used as a component of a final good/service.
  - Intermediate good is not counted in GDP - avoid duplicate count
* GDP is domestic production only
* GDP measures the value of production, which is also total expenditure on final goods = total income
* In factor market, households sell and firms buy service of labor, capital, and land
  - Y: firms pay wages, interest, rent
* In goods market, there are:
  - C: households purchase goods, called consumption expenditure (H(households) to goods market to F(firms))
  - G: government expenditure (Gov to goods market to F)
  - I: investment, money spent on purchasing capital (F to goods market back to F)
  - X-M: Net exports (global to local), where X = exports and M = imports

#### Calculation
* GDP = total expenditure = C + I + G + X - M (expenditure approach)
* GDP = total income = wages + interest + rent + profit = Y = C + I + G + (X-M), as firms pay out by sales of final goods (income approach)
* Domestic product != national product.
  - national product: produced anywhere in the world by the residents of a nation
* Gross: before deducting the depreciation of capital
* Depreciation: decrease in the value of a firm's capital that results from aging (wear and tear) and obsolescence
* Gross Investment: total amount spent on purchases of new capital & on replacing depreciated capital 
  - Net investment = gross investment - depreciation
* Gross profit: a firm's profit before substracting depreciation, is one of the incomes included in the income approach
* Income Approach: summing incomes that firms pay households.
  1. W: wages, salaries, and supplementart labor income
    - payment for labor services, wages + benefits
  2. OFI: other factor incomes
    - mixture of interest, rent, and profit. Include some labor income from self-employment.
* Y = W + OFI = *Net Domestic Income at Factor Cost*
* Two MUST MADE adjustment to GDP, when using income approach:
  1. Add indirect taxes, substract subsidies, from net domestic income at factor cost to ndi at market prices. 
    - for example, for specific tabacco/gasoline tax. It's not directly on receipt like HST, but it is still there and it's not counted as income of firms, but it is part of market price. 
    - subsidies is counted as income, but it shouldn't be.
  2. Add Depreciation, from net domestic income to gross domestic income = GDP (income approach)

#### Real GDP
* - nominal GDP: GDP valued at the prices that prevailed in that same year
  - real GDP: GDP valued at the prices of a reference base year
* Use of Real GDP: to compare the standard of living over time and across time
* Real GDP per person = Real GDP/ Population. 
  - can compare the standard of living over time.
  - any influence that rising prices / cost of living is removed
  - per person inticates value of goods that the average person can enjoy
* Handy way to compare R-GDP per person overtime: express as a ratio. aka GDPpp in 2016 is ~ times its 1961 level
* Two features of expanding living standard:
  - growth of potential GDPpp
  - fluctuation (irregular rising and falling) of realGDP around potential GDP
* Potential GDP: maximum quantity of real GDP that can be produced while avoiding shortages of labour, capital, land, and entrepreneurial ability that would bring rising inflation. Or GDP with full-employment
  - grows at a steady pace because the quantities of the factors of production and their productivities grow at a steady pace
  - but NOT at a constant pace
* Annual Percentage Change of R-GDPpp:
  - = (Real GDP per person in current yr - Real GDP pp in prev yr) / Real GDP pp in prev yr * 100
  - = average growth rate of R-GDPpp
* Rule of 70:
  - \# of years to double income/R-GDPpp = 70/auual percentage growth rate (aka annual perc change of R-GDPpp)
* Productivity Growth Slowdown:
  - Lucas wedge calculates the cost of slowdown. It's dollar value ofthe accumulated gap between R-GDPpp with 1960s growth rate and R-GDPpp now.
