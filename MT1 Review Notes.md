### Chap 1 Intro 

* Economics: Choice, Scarity, Incentives
* - positive statement: what it is, descriptive statment, could be right or wrong, can be tested
  - normative statement: what should be, opinion, cannot be tested 
* Economics divided into micro and macro economics
  - micro about market, specifc decision/choices, including government's action
  - macro about performance of national and global economics, more about social interest
* factors of production:
  - land: all "gift of natures", incentive is rent
  - labor: work time and effort, incentive is wages
  - capital: tools, machines, building, etc. incentive is interest
  - entrepreneurship: human resource to put above 3 together, earns profit
* choice = tradeoff; people making rational choice comparing costs and benefits
* benefit: the gain/pleasure it brings, determined by preference
* Preference: what a person likes and dislikes and the intensity
* Opportunity Cost: sth of highest-value alternative that MUST be given up to get it
  - money need to pay + time need to use

### Chap 2 Economic way of thinking
* PPF (production possibility frontier): boundary line of combination of goods/services
  - outside the frontier: unattainable
  - on and inside frontier: attainable
  - exactly on frontier: efficient
* marginal cost = opportunity cost of producing one more unit of it 
* marginal benefit = change in total benefit/change in quantity (usually one unit)
  - *principle of diminishing marginal benefit*: having more goods -> smaller marginal benefit & less willing to pay for additional unit
* marginal benefit curve: graph of margianl beneft of a good(on y axis) vs. quantity of good consumed(on x-axis)
* allocative efficiency: point on PPF at which marginal benefit = marginal cost
  - cannot product more good without giving up some other good we value more highlt
