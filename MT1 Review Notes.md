### Chap 1 Intro 

* Economics: Choice, Scarity, Incentives
* - positive statement: what it is, descriptive statment, could be right or wrong, can be tested
  - normative statement: what should be, opinion, cannot be tested 
* Economics divided into micro and macro economics
  - micro about market, specifc decision/choices, including government's action
  - macro about performance of national and global economics, more about social interest
* factors of production:
  - land: all "gift of natures", incentive is rent
  - labor: work time and effort, incentive is wages
  - capital: tools, machines, building, etc. incentive is interest
  - entrepreneurship: human resource to put above 3 together, earns profit
* choice = tradeoff; people making rational choice comparing costs and benefits
* benefit: the gain/pleasure it brings, determined by preference
* Preference: what a person likes and dislikes and the intensity
* Opportunity Cost: sth of highest-value alternative that MUST be given up to get it
  - money need to pay + time need to use

### Chap 2 The Economic Problem
* PPF (production possibility frontier): boundary line of combination of goods/services
  - outside the frontier: unattainable
  - on and inside frontier: attainable
  - exactly on frontier: efficient
* marginal cost = opportunity cost of producing one more unit of it 
* marginal benefit = change in total benefit/change in quantity (usually one unit)
  - *principle of diminishing marginal benefit*: having more goods -> smaller marginal benefit & less willing to pay for additional unit
* marginal benefit curve: graph of margianl beneft of a good(on y axis) vs. quantity of good consumed(on x-axis)
* allocative efficiency: point on PPF at which marginal benefit = marginal cost
  - cannot product more good without giving up some other good we value more highly
* economic growth:expansion of production possibilities, an increase of standard of living. Two factors:
  - technological change: new goods/ better ways of producing
  - capital accumulation: growth of capital resources, including human capital.
* economic growth is not free. Must decrease production of consumption goods and services and use the resources in research/development
* comparative advantage: higher OC; absolute advantage higher producing rate/productivities

### Chap 4 GDP

GDP: Gross Domestic Product, market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given time period.
* final good: an item bought by its final user during a specified time period
  - contracts with an intermediate good, which is produced by a firm and sold to another firm, used as a component of a final good/service.
  - Intermediate good is not counted in GDP - avoid duplicate count
* GDP is domestic production only
* GDP measures the value of production, which is also total expenditure on final goods = total income
* In factor market, households sell and firms buy service of labor, capital, and land
  - girms pay wages, interest, rent
* In goods market, there are:
  - C: households purchase goods, called consumption expenditure (H(households) to goods market to F(firms))
  - G: government expenditure (Gov to goods market to F)
  - I: investment, money spent on purchasing capital (F to goods market back to F)
  - X-M: Net exports (global to local), where X = exports and M = imports
* GDP = total expenditure = C + I + G + X - M
* GDP = total income = wages + interest + rent + profit = Y = C + I + G + (X-M), as firms pay out by sales of final goods

* Domestic product != national product.
  - national product: produced anywhere in the world by the residents of a nation
* Gross: before deducting the depreciation of capital
