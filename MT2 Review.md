## Chap 7 Finance, Saving, and Investment

### Distinguish between Finance and Money, Physical and Financial Capital
* Finance: the activity of providing the funds that finance expenditures on capital. It looks at how households and firms obtain and use financial resources and how they cope with the risks that arise in this activity.
* Money: what we use to pay for goods and services and factors of production and to make financial transactions. The study of money looks at how households and firms use it, how much of it they hold, how banks create and manage it, and how its quantity influences the economy.

* Physical capital: the tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other items that have been produced in the past and that are used today to produce goods and services. Example: Inventories of raw materials, semifinished goods, and components are part of physical capital. *When economists use the term capital, they mean physical capital.* 
* Financial capital: the funds that firms use to buy physical capital.
  
Investment increases the quantity of capital and depreciation decreases it      
**Net Inverstment = Gross Investment - Depreciation**     
**Total Capital = Initial Investment - Depreciation + Gross Investment**

### Wealth and Saving
Wealth is the value of all the things that people own. Saving is the amount of income that is not paid in taxes or spent on consumption goods and services. It is the source of the funds that are used to finance investment.
These funds are supplied and demanded in three types of financial markets.
1. Loan markets
    - for corporates, loans from bank
    - households: mortgage, outstanding credit card balance, etc.
2. Bond markets: 
    - Bond is a promise to make specified payments on specified dates. Could be in long or short terms.issued by corporates or government
    - mortgage-backed security: entitles its holder to the income from a package of mortgages. 不动产抵押
3. Stock markets: a financial market in which shares of stocks of corporations are traded. 
    - Stock is a certificate of ownership and claim to the firm’s profits.

### Financial institution
A firm that operates on both sides of the markets for financial capital. It is a borrower in one market and a lender in another.    
For example: banks, trust and loans, credit unions, pension funds, and insurance companies.    
* All financial institutions face risk, which poses two problems: solvency and liquidity problems.     
* Solvent: net worth is positive
    - insolvent: Net worth is negative. Must go out of business.
* Illiquid: the company has made long-term loans with borrowed funds and is faced with a sudden demand to repay more of what it has borrowed than its available cash.
    - normally, illiquit corps can borrow from other firms, depending on loan markets
    
### Interest Rates and Asset Prices
* Financial asset: Stocks, bonds, short-term securities and loans
* The price of an asset and the interest rate on that asset are determined simultaneously—one implies the other. 
**Interest Rate = Rate of Return = (Bond Payment / asset price) * 100**
* When asset price increases, interest rate actually decreases

In loanable funds market, **nominal interest rate** is the number of dollars that a borrower pays and a lender receives in interest in a year expressed as a percentage of the number of dollars borrowed and lent.
* **real interest rate = ( nominal interest rate ─ inflation rate )**

### The Loanable Funds Market   
The aggregate of all the individual financial markets.    
Funds come from three sources:
1. Household saving, S
2. Government budget surplus, (T – G)
    * T: Net taxes are taxes paid to government minus the cash transfers received from government.
    * G: Government expenditure
3. Borrowing from the rest of the world, (M – X) = (import - export)      

**Natioanl Saving = Private saving S + and government saving(T − G)**

Recall **Income(Y) = consumption expenditure(C) + saving(S) + net taxes(T)** and **GDP = wages + interest + rent + profit = Y = C + I + G + (X-M)**     

**Investment I = Household Saving S + Government Budget Surplus(T – G) + Borrowing from rest of the world(M - X)**
The market for loanable funds determines the real interest rate, the quantity of funds loaned, saving, and investment.

* Demands for Loanable Funds
    1. real interest rate UP, quantity of loanable funds demanded goes down, the point move towards up and left along the curve
    2. the greater the expected profit from new capital, the greater is the amount of investment and the greater the demand for loanable funds.  The demand for loanable funds changes and the demand curve shifts.

* Supply for loanable funds
The quantity of loanable funds supplied is the total funds available from private saving, the government budget surplus, and international borrowing during a given period. Our focus here is on saving.
    1. The real interest rate UP, quantity of loanable funds supplied UP. Point move up and right along the curve.
    2. Disposable income = income earned - net taxes
        * The greater a household’s disposable income, the greater is its saving.
        * Demand curve shifts to the right
    3. Expected future income UP, the smaller is its saving.
        * Demand curve shifts to the left
    4. Wealth UP, the smaller is its saving. (especially if because of a capital gain)
        * Demand curve shifts to the left
    5. Default risk: the risk that a loan will not be repaid
        * The greater that risk, the higher is the interest rate needed to induce a person to lend and the smaller is the supply of loanable funds.
        * risk UP, demand curve shifts to the left.
If one of the influences on saving plans changes and increases saving, the supply of loanable funds increases. An increase in disposable income, a decrease in expected future income, a decrease in wealth, or a fall in default risk increases saving and increases the supply of loanable funds.

### Government in the Loanable Funds Market
Government enters the loanable funds market when it has a budget surplus or budget deficit.
* A government budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds.
* A government budget deficit increases the demand for loanable funds
As curves shift, the real interest rate rises or falls.

## Chap 8 Money, Price Level, and Inflation

Money: any commodity or token that is generally acceptable as a means of payment. A means of payment is a method of settling a debt. When a payment has been made, there is no remaining obligation between the parties to a transaction.

Money Serves as:
  - Medium of exchange
      - otherwise we needs barter. Barter requires a double coincidence of wants, which rarely occurs
      - money isn’t the only medium of exchange. Credit card is not money
  - Unit of account: agreed-upon measure for stating the prices of goods and services.
      - it also simplifies Price Comparisons.
  - Store of value: it can be held and exchanged later for goods and services. 
      - otherwise it could not serve as a means of payment.
      - A house, a car, and a work of art are other examples of store of values.
      - Inflation lowers the value of money and the values of other commodities and tokens.
 
### Money in Canada Today
In Canada today, money consists of
1. currency: the notes 纸钞 and coins 硬币 held by individuals and businesses.
2. deposits at banks and other depository institutions: the deposits of individuals and businesses at banks and other depository institutions.

### Official Measures of Money
* M1 consists of currency held by individuals and businesses plus chequable deposits owned by individuals and businesses.
    - All the items in M1 are means of payment. M1 is money.
    
* M2 consists of M1 plus all other deposits ─ non-chequable deposits and fixed term deposits ─ held by individuals and businesses. 
    - M2 contains liquid assets: can easily be converted into a means of payment without loss in value.
    - Because the deposits in M2 can be quickly and easily converted into a means of payment, they are counted as money.

* Deposits are money but cheques and debit cards are NOT. Those are instructions to a bank to transfer money
* Credit card is not money. It's just an ID card that lets you take out a loan at the instant you buy something.

### Depository Institutions
A depository institution is a financial firm that takes deposits from households and firms. There are 3 kinds:
* Chartered banks: private firm chartered to the Bank Act
* Credit unions and caisses populaires: cooperative organization that operates under the Cooperative Credit Association Act 
* Trust and mortgage loan companies: these institutions receive deposits, make loans, and act as trustee for pension funds and for estates.


The goal of any bank is to **maximize the wealth of its owners**. So the interest rate at which it lends exceeds the interest rate it pays on deposits.

* Depositors’ funds are put into four types of assets:
    1. Reserves: notes and coins in its vault or its deposit at the Bank of Canada.
    2. Liquid assets: Government of Canada Treasury bills and commercial bills.
    3. Securities: longer-term Canadian government bonds and other bonds such as mortgage-backed securities.
        - These assets can be converted into reserves but at prices that fluctuate. Riskier than liquid assets, but also have a higher interest rate.
    4. Loans: commitments of fixed amounts of money for agreed-upon periods of time.

* Economic Benefits Provided by Depository Institutions:
    1. Create liquidity - borrowing short and lending long
    2. Pool risk - you lend to 1,000 people (through a bank) and one person defaults, you lose almost nothing
    3. Lower the cost of borrowing
    4. Lower the cost of monitoring borrowers - economies of scale
* Regulations:
    - Depository institutions engage in risky business. 
    - The goal of financial regulation is to identity, evaluate, and lessen the consequences of financial risk.
    - Provincial government agencies regulate credit unions and caisses populaires.
* financial innovation: seeking ways to improve the products in a process. 
    - Example: variable interest rate mortgages, credit cards, and daily-interest deposit accounts.
    - It has made little difference to the composition of money.

### The Bank of Canada
The Bank of Canada: a public authority that supervises other banks and financial institutions, financial markets, and the payments system, and conducts monetary policy.       
* The Bank of Canada has a restricted list of customers including other banks, the government, and the central banks of other countries.
* Its roles/objectives:
      - Banker to banks and government
      - Lender of last resort
      - Sole issuer of bank notes
* Structure (Board of Directors)
      - The Governor: Stephen S. Poloz
      - The Senior Deputy Governor: Carolyn A. Wilkins
      - The Deputy Minister of Finance: Paul Rochon
      - Twelve outside Directors
* Main assets (what you own): Government securities + Loans to depository institutions
* Liabilities (what you owe): Bank of Canada notes + Depository institution deposits

* Monetary Base = The Banks of Canada’s liabilities (notes+deposits) + Coins issued by the Royal Canadian Mint.
  Or, Monetary Base = Currency + Reserves (MB = C+R)

* Policy Tools
    - Open market operations: purchase or sale of government securities by the Bank of Canada from or to a chartered bank or the public.
        - The open market purchase increases bank reserves, and open market sale decreases bank reserves.
    - Bank rate: the interest rate that the BOC charges on the short-term, typically one-day, loans to major depository institutions is called the bank rate
        -  like an anchor for other short-term interest rates and is closely related to the Bank’s target for the overnight loans rate.

### How Banks creates money
* The quantity of deposits that banks can create is limited by three factors:
    1. Monetary base
    2. Desired reserves: the reserves that it plans to hold. 
        - The desired reserve ratio = bank’s reserves / total deposits that a bank plans to hold.
    3. Desired currency holding
        - The proportions of money held as currency and bank deposits depend on how households and firms choose to make payment.
        - leakage of bank reserves into currency = currency drain
* Money creation process
    - increase in  MB -> Excess reserves -> Banks lend excess reserves -> quantity of money increases
    - excess reserves = Actual reserves – desired reserves
    - When a bank has excess reserves, it makes loans and creates deposits and hence, the quantity of money increases
    
* Money multiplier = the ratio of the change in the quantity of money to the change in monetary base. 
    - The smaller the banks’ desired reserv ratio and the smaller the currency drain ratio, the larger is the money multiplier.
    - M/MB = (C+D)/(C+R)
    - currency drain ratio = C/D
    - deserved reserve ratio = R/D
    - mm (money multiplier) = (C/D + 1)/(C/D + R/D)

### Money Market
The quantity of money that people plan to hold depends on four main factors:
* The price level
    - Nominal money is the quantity of money measured in dollars. 
    - Real Monet = Nominal Money / Price Level
    - A rise in the price level increases the quantity of nominal money but doesn’t change the quantity of real money that people plan to hold.
* The nominal interest rate (up->amt hold down)
    -  opportunity cost of holding wealth in the form of money 
* Real GDP (up->amt hold up)
    - An increase in real GDP increases the volume of expenditure, which increases the quantity of real money that people plan to hold.
* Financial innovation (up -> amt hold down)
    -  lowers the cost of switching between money and interest-bearing assets

### Demand of Money
Quantity of real money demanded vs. the nominal interest rate.

* The demand curve would shift if: 
    * a increase in real GDP -> curve shifts to the right (the demand curve increases)
    * influence of financial innovation can be complicated. But generally innovations would decrease demand of money
* Short-Run Equilibruim
    - Supply curve 是个直线
    - if interest rate > equilibruim point: Excess supply of money
    - if interest rate < equilibruim point: Excess demand of money
    - interest rate 会根据这个继续改变
* Long-Run Equilibruim
    - recall that loanable funds market determines the real interest rate, and real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate.
    
### Quantity Theory of Money
In the long run, the price level adjusts to make the quantity of real money demanded equal the quantity supplied.        
* The quantity theory of money is a special theory of the price level and inflation that explains this long-run adjustment of the price level.
    - It is the proposition that, in the long run, an increase in the quantity of money brings an equal percentage increase in the price level.
* The velocity of circulation: 
    - average number of times a dollar of money is used annually to purchase goods and services that make up GDP
    - Velocity of circulation(V) = PriceLevel (P) * realGDP (Y) ÷ quantity of moniey(M)
    - Or, equation of exchange: MV = PY
    - in the long run, the price level P is determined by the quantity of money M
* **Inflation rate = Money growth rate + Growth rate of velocity - Real GDP growth rate**
* In the long run, speead of velocity does not change, so **Inflation rate = Money growth rate - Real GDP growth rate**

## Chap 9 Foreign Exchange Market
Foreign exchange market is the market in which the currency of one country is exchanged for the currency of another.      
Nominal Exchange Rate is the price at which one currency exchanges for another currency in the foreign exchange market.
* The Demand for One Money Is the Supply of Another Money
* Demand on the quantity of Canadian dollars  depends on:
    1. The exchange rate (y-axis): higher the exchange rate, the smaller is the quantity of Canadian dollars demanded
        - export effects: higher the exchange rate, less is the volume of Canadian exports.
    2. World demand for Canadian exports (rise->shifts right)
    3. Interest rates in Canada and other countries (differential rises->shifts right)
        - Canadian interest rate differential = Canadian interest rate - foreign interest rate
    4. The expected future exchange rate (rises->shifts right)
        - expected Profit Effect: 和现在的对比，expected越高，预计赚的越多，greater amount of demand
* Supply on CAD:
    1. The exchange rate (y-axis)
        - import effects: higher the rate, more imports we want to buy, so more supplied.
    2. Canadian demand for imports (rise->shifts right)
    3. Interest rates in Canada and other countries (rises->shifts left)
    4. The expected future exchange rate (rises->shifts left)

### Arbitrage
Arbitrage: 同時利用兩地利息率的差價和貨幣匯率的差價，流動資本以賺取利潤.
  * the practice of seeking to profit by buying in one market and selling for a higher price in another market. 
To avoid arbitrage, we want to have:
* The Law of One Price: if an item is traded in more than one place, the price will be the same in all locations.
* Interest Rate Parity: equal interest rates of return across currencie. Hence, for risk-free transactions, there is no gain from choosing one currency over another.
* Purchasing power parity **PPP**: Two products in different currencies actually have the same price. That is, after conversion, having the same purchasing power.

### Speculation
Speculation is trading on the expectation of making a profit. Unlike arbitrage which is certain to make profit, speculation does not have that certainty. It could be short term or long term. 
* Exchange rate forecasts are made over horizons. It has a lot of uncertainty, has many divergent forecasts, and the forecasts influence the outcome. The dependence of today’s exchange rate on forecasts of tomorrow’s exchange rate can give rise to exchange rate volatility in the short run.
* Exchange Rate Volatility - the rate constantly changing.
* Exchange Rate changes depends on market foundamentals

### Market Foundamentals
The Real Exchange Rate = relative price of Canadian-produced goods and services to foreign-produced goods and services.

In the short run, **RER = Nominal Exchange Rate(E) * Domestic Price Level(P) / Foreign Price Level(P_foreign)**

In the long run, **E = RER x P / P_foreign**

### Exchange Rate policy
1. flexible exchange rate: permits the exchange rate to be determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market with no direct intervention by the central bank. 
2. fixed exchange rate: pegs the exchange rate at a value decided by the government or central bank and is achieved by direct and active intervention in the foreign exchange market to block unregulated forces of demand and supply.
3. Crawling peg: works like a fixed exchange rate except that the target value changes. It follows a path determined by a decision of the
government or the central bank.
    - purpose: avoid wild swings in the exchange rate that might happen if expectations became volatile, and 
    - to avoid the problem of running out of reserves, which can happen with a fixed exchange rate.
