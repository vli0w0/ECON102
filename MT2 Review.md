## Chap 7 Finance, Saving, and Investment

### Distinguish between Finance and Money, Physical and Financial Capital
* Finance: the activity of providing the funds that finance expenditures on capital. It looks at how households and firms obtain and use financial resources and how they cope with the risks that arise in this activity.
* Money: what we use to pay for goods and services and factors of production and to make financial transactions. The study of money looks at how households and firms use it, how much of it they hold, how banks create and manage it, and how its quantity influences the economy.

* Physical capital: the tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other items that have been produced in the past and that are used today to produce goods and services. Example: Inventories of raw materials, semifinished goods, and components are part of physical capital. *When economists use the term capital, they mean physical capital.* 
* Financial capital: the funds that firms use to buy physical capital.
  
Investment increases the quantity of capital and depreciation decreases it      
**Net Inverstment = Gross Investment - Depreciation**     
**Total Capital = Initial Investment - Depreciation + Gross Investment**

### Wealth and Saving
Wealth is the value of all the things that people own. Saving is the amount of income that is not paid in taxes or spent on consumption goods and services. It is the source of the funds that are used to finance investment.
These funds are supplied and demanded in three types of financial markets.
1. Loan markets
    - for corporates, loans from bank
    - households: mortgage, outstanding credit card balance, etc.
2. Bond markets: 
    - Bond is a promise to make specified payments on specified dates. Could be in long or short terms.issued by corporates or government
    - mortgage-backed security: entitles its holder to the income from a package of mortgages. 不动产抵押
3. Stock markets: a financial market in which shares of stocks of corporations are traded. 
    - Stock is a certificate of ownership and claim to the firm’s profits.

### Financial institution
A firm that operates on both sides of the markets for financial capital. It is a borrower in one market and a lender in another.    
For example: banks, trust and loans, credit unions, pension funds, and insurance companies.    
* All financial institutions face risk, which poses two problems: solvency and liquidity problems.     
* Solvent: net worth is positive
    - insolvent: Net worth is negative. Must go out of business.
* Illiquid: the company has made long-term loans with borrowed funds and is faced with a sudden demand to repay more of what it has borrowed than its available cash.
    - normally, illiquit corps can borrow from other firms, depending on loan markets
    
### Interest Rates and Asset Prices
* Financial asset: Stocks, bonds, short-term securities and loans
* The price of an asset and the interest rate on that asset are determined simultaneously—one implies the other. 
**Interest Rate = Rate of Return = (Bond Payment / asset price) * 100**
* When asset price increases, interest rate actually decreases

In loanable funds market, **nominal interest rate** is the number of dollars that a borrower pays and a lender receives in interest in a year expressed as a percentage of the number of dollars borrowed and lent.
* **real interest rate = ( nominal interest rate ─ inflation rate )**

### The Loanable Funds Market   
The aggregate of all the individual financial markets.    
Funds come from three sources:
1. Household saving, S
2. Government budget surplus, (T – G)
    * T: Net taxes are taxes paid to government minus the cash transfers received from government.
    * G: Government expenditure
3. Borrowing from the rest of the world, (M – X) = (import - export)      

**Natioanl Saving = Private saving S + and government saving(T − G)**

Recall **Income(Y) = consumption expenditure(C) + saving(S) + net taxes(T)** and **GDP = wages + interest + rent + profit = Y = C + I + G + (X-M)**     

**Investment I = Household Saving S + Government Budget Surplus(T – G) + Borrowing from rest of the world(M - X)**
The market for loanable funds determines the real interest rate, the quantity of funds loaned, saving, and investment.

* Demands for Loanable Funds
    1. real interest rate UP, quantity of loanable funds demanded goes down, the point move towards up and left along the curve
    2. the greater the expected profit from new capital, the greater is the amount of investment and the greater the demand for loanable funds.  The demand for loanable funds changes and the demand curve shifts.

* Supply for loanable funds
The quantity of loanable funds supplied is the total funds available from private saving, the government budget surplus, and international borrowing during a given period. Our focus here is on saving.
    1. The real interest rate UP, quantity of loanable funds supplied UP. Point move up and right along the curve.
    2. Disposable income = income earned - net taxes
        * The greater a household’s disposable income, the greater is its saving.
        * Demand curve shifts to the right
    3. Expected future income UP, the smaller is its saving.
        * Demand curve shifts to the left
    4. Wealth UP, the smaller is its saving. (especially if because of a capital gain)
        * Demand curve shifts to the left
    5. Default risk: the risk that a loan will not be repaid
        * The greater that risk, the higher is the interest rate needed to induce a person to lend and the smaller is the supply of loanable funds.
        * risk UP, demand curve shifts to the left.
If one of the influences on saving plans changes and increases saving, the supply of loanable funds increases. An increase in disposable income, a decrease in expected future income, a decrease in wealth, or a fall in default risk increases saving and increases the supply of loanable funds.

### Government in the Loanable Funds Market
Government enters the loanable funds market when it has a budget surplus or budget deficit.
* A government budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds.
* A government budget deficit increases the demand for loanable funds
As curves shift, the real interest rate rises or falls.

## Chap 8 Money, Price Level, and Inflation

Money: any commodity or token that is generally acceptable as a means of payment. A means of payment is a method of settling a debt. When a payment has been made, there is no remaining obligation between the parties to a transaction.

Money Serves as:
  - Medium of exchange
      - otherwise we needs barter. Barter requires a double coincidence of wants, which rarely occurs.
      - money isn’t the only medium of exchange. Credit card is not money.
  - Unit of account: agreed-upon measure for stating the prices of goods and services.
      - it also simplifies Price Comparisons.
  - Store of value: it can be held and exchanged later for goods and services. 
      - otherwise it could not serve as a means of payment.
      - A house, a car, and a work of art are other examples of store of values.
      - Inflation lowers the value of money and the values of other commodities and tokens.
